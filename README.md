# [**Recipe app**](https://unasimov.github.io/recipe-app)

* ## Functionalies
    * Search for recipes
    * Sort by popularity, healthiness, time, servings
    * Displays list of recipes which are clickable
    * Ingredients can be checked off
    * An ingredient can be selected and adjusted, all other ones will adjust linearly
    * Toggle between ingredients and directions (efficiency, less scrolling!)
* ## Notes
    * Uses the spoonacular API so searches are limited, but can set new apiKey const variable in the js. This limit is why only 5 results show up per search (this can be increased).
    * After clicking search, it takes around 2-3 seconds for results to load.

* ## Future features
    * Filtering searches
    * Saving recipes to some favorites list
    * Comments by other users on recipes
